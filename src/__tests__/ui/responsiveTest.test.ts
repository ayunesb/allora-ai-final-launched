 * Manual responsive testing checklist
 * 
 * These tests need to be run manually to verify responsive design across devices.
 * You can use browser DevTools to simulate different screen sizes.
 * 
 * Viewport sizes to test:
 * - Mobile: 375px (iPhone SE), 390px (iPhone 12), 412px (Pixel 6)
 * - Tablet: 768px (iPad Mini), 834px (iPad Pro), 1024px (iPad Pro Landscape)
 * - Desktop: 1280px, 1440px, 1920px
 * - Ultra-wide: 2560px
 * 
 * Pages to test:
 * - Landing page
 * - Login/Signup
 * - Dashboard
 * - Admin pages
 * - Strategies page
 * - Profile page
 * - Settings pages
 * 
 * For each page, verify:
 * ✓ Layout doesn't break (no horizontal scrolling)
 * ✓ Text is readable (no overflow or truncation)
 * ✓ Buttons and inputs are usable and properly sized
 * ✓ Navigation works correctly (menu collapses on small screens)
 * ✓ Modals appear correctly and are usable
 * ✓ Tables have responsive alternatives for small screens
 * ✓ Forms maintain proper layout and field sizes
 * ✓ Images scale appropriately
 * ✓ Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile
